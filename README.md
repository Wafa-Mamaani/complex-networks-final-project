# Complex Networks Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the "Complex Networks" course, focusing on the analysis of five real-world networks using Python and NetworkX:

1. **Zachary’s Karate Club**  
2. **Les Misérables co-occurrence network**  
3. **College Football network**  
4. **Email-Eu-core network**  
5. **Facebook Social Circles network**

The project involves computing key structural metrics, community detection, and simulating the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model to study dynamic spreading processes.

## 📂 Contents

- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks with all the Python code for analysis  
- `Complex_Networks_Final_Report.pdf` – Comprehensive written report  
- `figures/` – Visualizations of network structures, centrality distributions, community structures, and SI model simulations  
- `data/` – Datasets (if small and allowed to share; otherwise mention download links)  

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries

- Python (Google Colab environment)  
- NetworkX  
- python-louvain (for Louvain community detection)  
- Matplotlib, NumPy  

## 📊 Key Concepts

- Centrality measures: Degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector  
- Clustering coefficient (local and global)  
- Community detection: Girvan–Newman and Louvain algorithms  
- SI model simulation for dynamic spreading  

## 🌐 Data Sources

- [Stanford SNAP Datasets](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/)

## 📄 Report

The final report (`Complex_Networks_Final_Report.pdf`) includes a comprehensive analysis, detailed explanations of methods, and visualizations for all networks.
